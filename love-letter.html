                <p>
                   My Darling, you have never left my mind since the day we met. From the moment you came into my life you made the world glow around me, you made everything warmer, the world has seemed brighter. Whenever you leave, it's like you take the sun with you. I'm happier than I could have ever imagined and I feel so safe in this warmth that I can barely remember what life was like before you. I have forgotten how to imagine a future without you in it.
I feel like I’ve known you my whole life, like you understand me in ways no other person could. You give me patience and understanding, you get my humour, my joys, you know me inside and out. You get ME. This is real. My love and devotion to you is the real deal. It’s the most natural feeling I’ve ever known: Loving you is as easy as breathing.

                
                </p> I find you in everything. Every part of my day somehow leads back to you.
Every lyric I hear, every flower I pass, the stars in the sky
and every little joke I can't wait to pass on to you. You are in all my thoughts and all my hopes for the future. I'm glad it's you I get to share my life with.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I know we have had our differences and struggles, but thank you for pushing through with me, never giving up hope, I think we have come a long way. I want you to know that I notice everything you do for me. Every time you check in on me, how much time and money you spend to make sure I have a good time too, every hug, every embrace, everything. Nobody makes me feel as loved as you. I have more trust in you than I ever thought possible. I know it’s been hard but I really do think we have turned a corner. We’re strong together and we can get through anything. You’re my best friend, my partner, my soulmate. I trust you. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm so proud to call you my girlfriend. You make me want to be a better person, someone who makes you as happy as you make me.
                    I learn more and more about you everyday, and I can't wait to learn even more about you tomorrow. I want to know you. The good, the bad, the quirky little things you probably wouldn't even notice. I want to know it all. I want to love it all, every part of you, all of you. You are my everything.
                </p>
